## Pseudocode 

### Board Setup
> ðŸ¥… Setup a 9x9 board where a user can interact with each cell by inputing a number 1-9. 
1. Create the board structure in memory
    - initilize and empty array to repeat the board. `let board = []`
   - Use loop to create the rows:
        - initialze row array
        - for each column, add placeholder to represent an empty cell
    - push the row array to the board arry
2. Build the board in DOM

        - Create a new DOM element to represent a row.
        - For each column:
            - Create an input element for the cell
            - Set it to accept only one character
            - Add any necessary classes or data attributes to identify its position
            - Append the cell to the row element
        - Append the row element to the board container
3. Style the board
    - make the cells all same lxh
    - make all sub-grids stand out
4. Trigger the board to get created on page load
